Inspired by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Author Notes
This project was created to assist developers with kick-starting their fullstack React applications, but without the bloat that create-react-app contains, and more-so hides nothing; everything you see, is everything you get!

## How to use

### `rks (location) [-d]`

  
Bootstraps a React app in the destination/ folder name of your choice. Use "-d" flag to bootstrap a Docker-based fullstack React application.
